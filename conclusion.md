# Summary
You did it! You made it through a huge wall of text explaining why and how you should test your microservices. Remember the test pyramid, write unit, integration and high-level tests and get your hands dirty with this CDC thingy!

I know, this is a lot to digest. Hopefully this wasn't all new to you so you can focus on the things that are new to you. If you're craving for code now and want to see all these concepts in action, my [second post](/blog/testing-java-microservices) should be your next stop.

If you feel that you need more in-depth information on a certain topic, take a look at my list of further resources. They should keep you busy for a while.

Happy testing!

You did it! You made it through a huge wall of text explaining why and how you should test your software. The great news is that this information is pretty timeless and independent on what kind of software you're building. Wether you're working on a microservices landscape, IoT devices, mobile apps or web applications, the learnings from this article can be applied to all of these.

When turning this into action remember the test pyramid, write unit, integration and high-level tests and get your hands dirty with this CDC thingy!

I know, this is a lot to digest. Hopefully this wasn't all new to you so you can focus on the things that are new to you.

If you feel that you need more in-depth information on a certain topic, take a look at my list of further resources. They should keep you busy for a while.

# Tools and Libraries We'll Look at
This post will demonstrate several tools and libraries that help us implement automated tests. The most important ones are:

  * [**JUnit**](http://junit.org) as our test runner
  * [**Mockito**](http://site.mockito.org/) for mocking dependencies
  * [**Wiremock**](http://wiremock.org/) for stubbing out third-party services
  * [**MockMVC**](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-testing.html#boot-features-testing-spring-boot-applications-testing-autoconfigured-mvc-tests) for writing HTTP integration tests
  * [**Pact**](https://docs.pact.io/) for writing CDC tests
  * [**Selenium**](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) for writing UI-driven end-to-end tests
  * [**REST-assured**](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured) for writing REST API-driven end-to-end tests
